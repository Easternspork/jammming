# Jammming React App  

My first ever react app! Part of the Full Stack developer course on Codecademy.  
HTML & CSS & images were supplied by Codecademy - I only created the React related stuff of the website.  
Search for songs on spotify and create spotify playlists with Jammming!   
Practice with react components and stuff; Live at easternspork-jammming.surge.sh!
